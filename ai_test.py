"""
This script is used to test the AI agents in a local environment. It generates a random
board and then asks the AI to generate a clue. The board and clue are then printed to
the console. The answer is revealed when the user presses Enter.

To run this script, simply execute it from the command line. You can optionally provide
a seed value as an argument to reproduce a specific game board. For example:

    python ai_test.py 1234
